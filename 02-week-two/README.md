##week 2
#Getting started with Javascript. And getting serious with html and css.

###REMEMBER:
week 1 work due on Monday.

##oooh, javascript.
You are about to do some programming. You are about to program using Javascript.
###Do these things:  
- sign up at codeyear.com / codecademy.com if you haven't already.  
- complete the week 1 courses from codeyear.com
  - do the Getting Started with Progamming lesson
  - and the FizzBuzz project.
  
Now, the above activities may seem disconnected from everything you've ever done before. "Why should I care if numbers are divisible by 3 or 5?" You might say. Or maybe you'll say, "Screw this shit." Don't freak out. Everything is ok, even if FizzBuzz doesn't make sense at first.  

_Here's why it's important:_  
### You must learn to program, and to program, you must learn to think analytically.

- If you haven't already, watch all the videos at dontfeartheinternet.com

##your site on heroku.com
So last week you pushed a tiny site with test content to heroku.com. Good work!
This week you need to change the content and edit the html and css to create a design that reflects your aesthetic sensibilities.

###what kind of content?
Think of this as preparation for the portfolio site that you'll turn in at the end of the quarter. I mean, heck, that's what it is!  
So add some basic content to your portfolio, stuff like your goals for the quarter, links to relevant websites like your blog, accounts on codecademy.com, heroku.com, github.com, etc.  
Experiment a little.  

##read some stuff:
- Read chapter two of _The Design of Everyday Things_.
- Read chapter one of _Sinatra: Up and Running_.
  - You may start reading this and say, "Dang, I don't know what any of this is talking about."
  - This is normal.
  - Deal with it.
  - Attempt to recreate the basic examples it gives you. Use what you learned about the command line from week one.
  - Do your best to follow along with the examples on your own. Ask questions.
  - If you can't get it to work, it's ok. We'll go over this stuff on Monday of week 3.
 
  
#recap: stuff you'll turn in monday of week 3:
- Blog some screenshots of your progress with codeyear courses, and write about what it was like to get started programming.  
- Write a 500+ word blog post that combines what you've learned from dontfeartheinternet.com and _The Design of Everyday Things_.  
- Do a blog post with screenshots of and a link to your revised portfolio site.  
- Do a blog post that shows how far you got in following the instructions from chapter one of _Sinatra: Up and Running_.
